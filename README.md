# Project Title: Jokes Market
The "Joke Stocks Market" is an innovative, entertaining web application that brings together humor and trading in a very unique way. The application works as a platform for creating, sharing, and trading jokes as digital assets. Every joke posted on the platform gains value based on its popularity, which is determined by the number of likes it receives from other users. This popularity not only reflects the joke's entertainment value but also serves as a form of virtual currency within the app's trading system.

The core software development principles are well reflected in the app. The CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations are implemented; for example, users can create new jokes, and the system will store the joke and then display the same to other users for view. These jokes can be edited at any time by their creators, so users can refine their humor or correct mistakes. If a user decides that they no longer want a certain joke to be public, they can delete it and remove it permanently from the system. This basic functionality ensures that users have full control over the content they contribute to the platform.
